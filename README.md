I made this bot to help with my college class's Discord Server.

## Running/Hosting this Bot locally

If you want to host it locally (on your machine/laptop/PC) - run
```node myBot.js```
in the Command Prompt/PowerShell/etc.

*Please note: hosting the Bot locally like this means that it will be offline when your system (PC) is powered down/off!*

## Hosting this Bot externally

There are plenty of guides out there on the Internet for hosting a Discord.js Bot externally (on a Server/VPS).
I used DigitalOcean, which is really good and cheap....ish. If you call around Â£4 per month cheap :P
